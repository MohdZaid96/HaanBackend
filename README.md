# Sanitizer & Hand Sanitizer E-commerce Backend

Welcome to the Haan(Sanitizer E-commerce websites Backend) repository! This project is dedicated to building a robust backend system for an e-commerce platform specializing in sanitizers. Our mission is to provide a secure, efficient, and seamless experience for users, allowing them to place orders and have their products delivered to their doorstep.

## Unveiling Seamless Functionality

### Authentication & Authorization
Security is our top priority. Our backend system incorporates advanced authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts. Our sophisticated authorization protocols ensure that every user interaction is secure and authorized.

### Effortless Data Management
We utilize a cutting-edge database system to power our platform. This database enables efficient storage and retrieval of data, facilitating faster transactions and a smooth user journey.

## Pioneering Technologies

### JavaScript
JavaScript, the language of the web, is at the core of our backend system. We leverage JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive platform that provides a seamless user experience.

### Node.js
Our backend system is built using Node.js, which offers unparalleled scalability and speed. The asynchronous nature of Node.js ensures that user interactions remain responsive and efficient.

### MongoDB
We embrace the future of data storage with MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides a flexible, schema-less structure. This enhances agility and performance, making it ideal for handling e-commerce data.
